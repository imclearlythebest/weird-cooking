  introDialogue:
  - The problem isn't that we can't find Kkusum,
  - the problem is within this knife.
  - Basically, it doesn't have a good handle
  - and the sharpness tastes too purple.
  - I think I will open it up and give it a modern rubberized texture.
  defaultDialogue:
  - '*Keeps rambling about his knife*'
